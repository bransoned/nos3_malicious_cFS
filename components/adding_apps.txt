Steps to add a new cFS app in the NOS3 simulation:

./components/sample/generate_template.sh <new name here>

All files will now be in:

./components/<new name here>

Add new component name and follow general structure to these FSW files:

./cfg/nos3_defs/cpu1_cfe_es_startup.scr
./cfg/nos3_defs/targets.cmake
./cfg/nos3_defs/tables/* # not really sure when this is needed

Add new component name and follow general structure to there GSW files:

./gsw/cosmos/config/system/system.txt
./gsw/cosmos/config/tools/cmd_tlm_server/cmd_tlm_server.txt
./scripts/launch.sh


Not really sure how to format this one. Just follow sample ig?
./cfg/sims/nos3-simulator.xml
